The augmented implicitly restarted Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm (IRLBA)
finds a few approximate largest singular values and corresponding singular
vectors of a sparse or dense matrix using a method of Baglama and Reichel.

> J. Baglama and L. Reichel, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. (2005). (http://www.math.uri.edu/~jbaglama/papers/paper14.pdf)

It is a fast and memory-efficient way to compute a partial SVD, principal
components, and some specialized partial eigenvalue decompositions.

I introduced Baglama and Reichel's irlba algorithm to the R world in a talk at
the useR! conference in Dortmund way back in 2008, and a stable version of the
package has been on CRAN for more than five years.

# What's new

The current stable version of the package is 2.1.0 (August 2016).

Version 2.1.0 of the package includes a convenience `prcomp`-like function for
computing principal components and a fast C-language implementation for
improved computational speed. The original R algorithm implementation is
maintained for some special cases and for reference.

# Vignettes

The package vignette (PDF): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irlba/irlba.pdf.

This example uses a special one-sided basis option and a custom matrix product
to compute the top three principal components of the entire 1000 Genomes
Project variant data set (whole genome variants for 2,504 people):
http://bwlewis.github.io/1000_genomes_examples/PCA_whole_genome.html The
example optionally works in parallel and finishes in only 8 minutes on a 4 node
Linux cluster.

https://bwlewis.github.io/irlba/comparison.html compares the irlba package
with the RSpectra package, a high-quality eigenvalue solver for R.

## Other applications

The newe `tcor` algorithm (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07246) and R package
(https://github.com/bwlewis/tcor -- not yet on CRAN) use irlba to compute
thresholded correlation matrices very quickly. This example computes the most
highly correlated gene expressions from the Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq gene
expression data for breast cancer:
